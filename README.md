## Installation

Install SSA-Tools using pip:

```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Joblib
- Numba

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ssa_tools import SSA

# Generate sample data (sine wave + noise)
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
signal = np.sin(t) + 0.5 * np.sin(5 * t) + 0.2 * np.random.randn(len(t))

# Initialize SSA with parameters
ssa = SSA(
    data=signal,
    lag=100,  # Window length
    numComp=8,  # Number of components to extract
    method="accelerated",  # Use accelerated implementation
    decomposition="EVD"  # Eigenvalue decomposition
)

# Perform SSA decomposition
ssa.computeSSA()

# Plot reconstructed components
ssa.plotReconstructedComponents()

# Analyze variance explained by components
ssa.plotVarianceExplained()

# Compute weighted correlations between components
ssa.computeWCA()

# Plot correlation heatmap
ssa.plotWeightedCorrelations()

# Find related components
correlated_pairs = ssa.detectCorrelatedComponents(listPairs=True)

```

## Detailed Usage

### SSA Class

The main interface to the package is the `SSA` class, which has the following key parameters:

```python
SSA(
    data,           # 1D time series as numpy array
    lag,            # Window length (2 <= lag < len(data)//2)
    numComp,        # Number of components (1 <= numComp <= lag)
    method="classic", # "classic" or "accelerated"
    decomposition="EVD", # "SVD" or "EVD"
    threshold=0.9   # Correlation threshold for grouping
)
```

### Component Analysis

After performing SSA decomposition with `computeSSA()`, you can access:

- `ssa.RC`: Reconstructed components matrix
- `ssa.eigenvalues`: Eigenvalues for each component
- `ssa.eigenvectors`: Eigenvectors from decomposition

### Weighted Correlation

Compute and analyze correlations between components:

```python
# Compute weighted correlations
ssa.computeWCA()

# Access correlation matrix
wcorr_matrix = ssa.WCorr

# Find related components
correlated_pairs = ssa.detectCorrelatedComponents()
```

### Choosing Window Length

The window length (`lag`) parameter is crucial for SSA performance:

- For periodic signals, `lag` should be larger than the period of interest
- For trend extraction, larger values of `lag` capture longer-term trends
- Typical values range from N/10 to N/2, where N is the signal length
- For initial exploration, a value around N/4 often works well

### Classic vs. Accelerated Implementation

Choose the right implementation for your needs:

- **Classic SSA**: 
  - Supports both SVD and EVD decomposition
  - Better for smaller datasets
  - More straightforward to understand and debug

- **Accelerated SSA**:
  - Only supports EVD decomposition
  - Significantly faster for large datasets
  - Uses multi-threading and JIT compilation
  - Optimized for numerical efficiency

## Advanced Examples

### Signal Filtering

```python
import numpy as np
from ssa_tools import SSA

# Generate noisy signal
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
clean = np.sin(t) + 0.5 * np.sin(5 * t)
noisy = clean + 0.5 * np.random.randn(len(t))

# SSA filtering
ssa = SSA(noisy, lag=100, numComp=2)
ssa.computeSSA()

# First two components represent filtered signal
filtered = np.sum(ssa.RC[:, :2], axis=1)

# Calculate filtering performance
mse = np.mean((filtered - clean)**2)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.6f}")
```

### Trend Extraction

```python
import numpy as np
from ssa_tools import SSA

# Generate data with trend and seasonality
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
trend = 0.01 * t**2
seasonal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)
noise = 0.2 * np.random.randn(len(t))
signal = trend + seasonal + noise

# Extract trend with SSA
ssa = SSA(signal, lag=200, numComp=10)
ssa.computeSSA()

# Compute correlations
ssa.computeWCA()

# First component is usually the trend
extracted_trend = ssa.RC[:, 0]
```

```python
from ssa_tools import SSA

# Initialize
ssa = SSA(data, lag, numComp, method, decomposition, threshold)

# Core methods

RC, eigenvectors, eigenvalues = classic_ssa(signal, lag, numComp, decomposition)

# Accelerated SSA implementation
RC, eigenvectors, eigenvalues = accelerated_ssa(signal, lag, numComp)

SSA Tools: Accelerated Singular Spectrum Analysis

A Python package for Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) with accelerated performance for large datasets.
Overview

Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a powerful method for time-series decomposition based on spectral decomposition. However, the classical implementation of SSA is computationally expensive, limiting its application to small datasets.

This package provides an accelerated SSA function, allowing SSA to be applied to large datasets within a reasonable time.

ðŸ”¹ Why Use This Package?

âœ” Fast & efficient implementation

âœ” Works with large time-series data, even with sensor signals with sampling up to 2 MHz!

âœ” Supports both classic and accelerated SSA

Installation

You can install the package using:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/TinoDerb/ssa_tools.git
```

Or, if using PyPI:

```
pip install ssa_tools
```

# Usage

```
import numpy as np
import ssa_tools
signal = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100)) # Generate a sample signal
components = ssa_tools.SSA(signal, lag=20, numComp=5, method="classic") # Apply SSA (classic method)
components_fast = ssa_tools.SSA(signal, lag=20, numComp=5, method="accelerated") # Apply SSA (accelerated method)
print(components.shape)  # (100, 5)
print(components_fast.shape)  # (100, 5)
```
